# 🌌 Antigravity Vibe Kit

> **ONE VIBE, ONE KIT, NO YAPPING.**

## 🎯 Mission
A no-nonsense toolkit for setting up **AI Agentic Contexts**, skills, and workflows for personal projects. Designed for full-stack (FE + BE) development with a unified, "No Yapping" philosophy.

## 🚀 Features
- **Unified Agentic Setup**: Pre-configured roles for Backend, Frontend, BA, QA, and DevOps.
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Instant scaffolding for Java (Spring Boot) and React (Vite) projects.
- **Strict Standards**: Enforced Clean Architecture and atomic operations.

## 🛠 Usage
Initialize a new project with the unified agent team:

```bash
# Run directly from terminal (No Clone Required)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hunghlh98/vibe-kit/main/bin/vibe-init.sh)"
```

Or clone and run manually:
```bash
./bin/vibe-init.sh
```

Follow the prompts to select your stack (Backend, Frontend, or Fullstack).

## 🧠 Brain Injection
The kit automatically injects:
- **`.agent/skills`**: Specialized skills for Java/React agents.
- **`AGENTS.md`**: The roster of active AI personas.
- **Workflows**: Standard operating procedures for recurring tasks.

## 📜 Philosophy
- **Maximum Compression**: Minimum wording, maximum impact.
- **Agent First**: Code structure designed for AI operational efficiency.
- **Structure**: Core facts only.
